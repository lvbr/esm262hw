# Loading Data

The data set climate was modified to include month names and separate years by seasons

```{r load data}
other_data = data.frame(month=seq(1,12),
                      month_names=month.abb,
                      season = c(1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,1))

climate=read.table("clim.txt", header=T) %>% 
  left_join(other_data) %>% 
  mutate(temp = (tmin+tmax)/2) 
```

# Task 1 

Precipitation and average temperature by month

```{r task1, fig.cap = "Precipitation by moth"}
ggplot(data=climate, aes(x=as.factor(month), y=rain)) +
  geom_boxplot(color="darkblue") +
  stat_summary(geom="point", fun.y = "mean", color="red") +
  xlab("Month") +
  ylab("Precipitation") +
  theme_bw() +
  removeGrid(x=TRUE, y=TRUE) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels=month.abb)
```

\clearpage

```{r task2, fig.cap = "Temperature by month"}
ggplot(data=climate, aes(x = as.factor(month), y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill= "aquamarine3", color = "black") +
  stat_summary(geom="point", fun.y = "mean", color="red") +
  xlab("Month") +
  ylab("Temperature") +
  theme_bw() +
  removeGrid(x=TRUE, y=TRUE) + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels=month.abb)
```

# Task 2 

Find wettest and driest years

```{r fig.cap = "Total precipitation by year"}
rain_year <- climate %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(total_rain = sum(rain))

ggplot(data = rain_year, aes(x = year, y = total_rain)) + 
  geom_line(color = "gray63") +
  geom_point(color = "dodgerblue4") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Total precipitation") +
  theme_bw() +
  removeGrid(x=TRUE, y=TRUE) 
```



The driest year was `r rain_year$year[rain_year$total_rain == min(rain_year$total_rain)]` with a total precipitation of `r min(rain_year$total_rain)`. The wettest was `r rain_year$year[rain_year$total_rain == max(rain_year$total_rain)]` with a total precipitation of `r max(rain_year$total_rain)`.

# Task 3 

Illustrate what a wet and dry year might look like for the ecosystem of your choice

## A wet day in the tropics

![Amazon Tropical Rain Forest](./rainforest.jpg)

\clearpage

## A dry day in La Guajira desert 
![La Guajira](./guajira.jpg) 

\clearpage

# Task 4
Find wettest and driest seasons  

```{r seasons, fig.cap = "Total precipitation by seasons"}
rain_season <- climate %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  summarise(total_rain = sum(rain))

ggplot(data = rain_season, aes(x = as.character(season), y = total_rain)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "gray63") +
  xlab("Season") +
  ylab("Total precipitation") +
  theme_bw() +
  removeGrid(x=TRUE, y=TRUE) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Winter","Spring","Summer","Fall"))
```


The wettest season is winter and the driest is summer

#Task 5 

Graph the relationship between winter precipitation and summer temperature

```{r fig.cap = "Total winter precipitation vs Average summer temperature"}
climate %>% 
  group_by(year, season) %>% 
  summarise(total_rain = sum(rain),
            temp = mean(temp)) -> rain_temp

temp <- rain_temp %>% 
  filter(season == 3) %>% 
  select(year, temp)

rain_temp %>% 
  filter(season == 1) %>% 
  select(year, total_rain) %>% 
  left_join(temp) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total_rain, y = temp, color = year)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  removeGrid(x=TRUE, y=TRUE) +
  labs(x = "Winter Precipitation", y = "Summer Temperature")
```

For the period 1942 to 2016, there is no obvious relationship between the total precipitation in winter and the average summer temperature.
